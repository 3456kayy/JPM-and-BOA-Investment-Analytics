<h1>Stock Investment Analytics</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This project examines the financial performance between J.P. Morgan Chase Bank and Bank of America, focusing on both qualitative and quantitative aspects. Data mining techniques were used to gather and analyze information from multiple sources, including the companies' annual 10-K reports, Yahoo and or Google Finance. Tools such as Excel were used to calculate various financial ratios, including revenue productivity, comprehensive efficiency, operating efficiency and etc. The Excel screenshots illustrate how the data was input and visualized for concise interpretation and comparison prior to purchasing stocks.
<br /><br />
The outcome of this analysis revealed that Chase Bank outperformed Bank of America in key areas such as revenue productivity and comprehensive efficiency, with Chase’s financial strength continuing to grow year over year. However, Chase’s debt management raised concerns, as it showed a heavier reliance on debt compared to its competitor. These findings indicate that, while Chase Bank demonstrates strong performance, improvements in cash flow and debt management could further enhance its competitive standing in the banking sector.
