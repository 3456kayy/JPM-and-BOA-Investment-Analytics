<h1>Encryption/Decryption with Bash</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project addresses the protection of sensitive healthcare information, specifically focusing on safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI) using encryption. A Bash script was developed to encrypt files containing healthcare data, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations such as HIPAA. The script secures sensitive documents by transforming them into an unreadable format during transit, with only authorized users able to decrypt the files using a valid password.
<br /><br />
To ensure reliable security, the script enforces strong password protocols and limits login attempts to prevent unauthorized access. It also logs user activities, providing an audit trail for tracking access, a key requirement in healthcare data protection. The implementation of AES-256 encryption further fortifies the system, making healthcare information significantly less vulnerable to data breaches. This solution demonstrates the scriptâ€™s effectiveness in creating a secure environment for handling ePHI in healthcare.
